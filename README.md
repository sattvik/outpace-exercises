# outpace-exercise

This is my implementation of the exercise from Outpace.  To run, you can use
`lein run`.  There are two optional arguments that may be given to the program:

1. If no arguments are given, input is read from standard input and results are
   printed to standard output.
2. If one argument is given, it is assumed to be the path to an input file.
   Results will be printed to standard output.
3. If two arguments are given, the first is the path to an input file and the
   second will be the path to an output file.

In all cases, if the input file is of an invalid format, an error will be
printed to standard error.
